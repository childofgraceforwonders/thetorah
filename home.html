                            <p>Before examining the Son, it is crucial to understand the nature of God the Father. Theology asserts that God is an infinite entity who cannot be fully quantified or contained by human reason or language. He is spirit, and our finite, physical minds struggle to comprehend His infinite, non-physical reality. We do not get to dictate how God manifests; He is sovereign.</p>
                            <blockquote><span class="pink-highlight">"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts." (Isaiah 55:8-9)</span></blockquote>
                            <blockquote><span class="pink-highlight">"But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you..." (1 Kings 8:27)</span></blockquote>
                            <blockquote><span class="pink-highlight">"[He] who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see." (1 Timothy 6:16)</span></blockquote>
                            <p>Understanding this helps frame the doctrine of the Trinity. God is one, yet He has manifested Himself in different forms or persons without compromising His oneness. His Word is not merely a sound or a message; it is a perfect, divine expression of Himself—a person *within* His own being.</p>

                            <p>This brings us to the foundational concept of Jesus as the "Word" (Greek: *Logos*). This title is the theological bridge to understanding His divine nature as a manifestation of the infinite God.</p>
                            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Core Passage:</h3>
                            <blockquote><span class="pink-highlight">"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and <strong>the Word was God.</strong>"</span></blockquote>
                            <blockquote><span class="pink-highlight">"And <strong>the Word became flesh</strong> and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth." (John 1:1, 14)</span></blockquote>
                            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Theological Breakdown:</h3>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
                                <li><strong>The Word is Eternal:</strong> It existed "in the beginning."</li>
                                <li><strong>The Word is Distinct from God (the Father):</strong> It was "with God."</li>
                                <li><strong>The Word is God in Essence:</strong> It "was God."</li>
                                <li><strong>The Word is Jesus:</strong> It "became flesh."</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Therefore, the logic follows: Jesus is the Word, and the Word is God. He is the eternal self-expression of the uncontainable God made manifest in human form.</p>

                                <p class="font-semibold">Q1: Is Jesus the same person as God the Father?</p>
                                <p><strong>A:</strong> No. The Bible presents them as distinct persons. The Father sent the Son (John 3:16), and the Son prays to the Father (John 17). The doctrine of the Trinity states they are one in divine *essence* or *nature*, but distinct in *personhood*.</p>

                                <p class="font-semibold">Q2: If Jesus is God, why did he say "the Father is greater than I"?</p>
                                <p><strong>A:</strong> This refers to Jesus's role and position during his earthly life (his *incarnation*). In becoming human, he voluntarily took on a subordinate role to the Father to fulfill his mission. It is a statement about his function, not his essential divine nature, which is equal to the Father's.</p>

                                <p class="font-semibold">Q3: What does it mean that Jesus is the "Word of God"?</p>
                                <p><strong>A:</strong> The "Word" (or *Logos*) is God's perfect self-expression. Think of it as the mind, reason, and power of God. The Bible says this "Word" is not just an idea but a divine person who has always existed with God and as God. This divine person became human as Jesus.</p>

                                <p class="font-semibold">Q4: Did the idea of God's "Word" being a person start with Christianity?</p>
                                <p><strong>A:</strong> No. As shown in Section 4, the Old Testament already described God's Word as an active, personal agent that "came" to prophets, created the universe, and accomplished God's will. This existing Jewish concept was the foundation for understanding Jesus as that Word made flesh.</p>

                                <p class="font-semibold">Q5: Is there a clear verse where God the Father calls Jesus "God"?</p>
                                <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. Hebrews 1:8 is the clearest instance. The author states that the Father says *to the Son*, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever." Here, the Father directly addresses the Son using the title "God."</p>
