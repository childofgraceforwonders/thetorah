                            <p><strong>Tel Dan Stele:</strong> Discovered in 1993, this 9th-century BCE stone fragment contains an inscription from an Aramean king boasting of his victory over the "king of Israel" and the "king of the House of David." This was the first extrabiblical text to mention the Davidic dynasty, providing strong evidence for King David's historicity.</p>
                            <p><strong>Hezekiah's Tunnel & Siloam Inscription:</strong> This 1,750-foot tunnel was dug beneath Jerusalem to secure the city's water supply, exactly as described in 2 Kings 20 and 2 Chronicles 32. An inscription found inside describes the moment the two teams of diggers, working from opposite ends, met in the middle.</p>
                            <p><strong>Dead Sea Scrolls:</strong> This vast collection of manuscripts, discovered from 1947 onwards, contains copies of every book in the Old Testament (except Esther). Dating to before the time of Jesus, they demonstrate the remarkable accuracy with which the biblical text was preserved over centuries.</p>

                            <h4>New Testament Discoveries</h4>
                            <p><strong>The Pilate Stone:</strong> Found in Caesarea in 1961, this limestone block is inscribed with the name "Pontius Pilate, Prefect of Judea." It is a direct archaeological confirmation of the existence and title of the Roman governor who, according to the Gospels, presided over the trial of Jesus.</p>
                            <p><strong>House of Peter in Capernaum:</strong> Excavations in Capernaum, on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, uncovered a 1st-century house that was venerated as a public gathering place by early Christians. It was later enclosed within an octagonal church, a common practice for holy sites. This is widely held to be the home of the Apostle Peter mentioned in Matthew 8:14.</p>
                             <p><strong>Pool of Siloam:</strong> In 2004, archaeologists uncovered a large, stone-stepped pool in Jerusalem that perfectly matches the description of the Pool of Siloam from John 9, where Jesus healed a blind man. Coins found in the plaster date it to the 1st century CE.</p>

                            <h4>A Testimony to a Historical Figure</h4>
                            <p>It is crucial to note that these perspectives, while deeply respectful, do not affirm the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God or part of the Trinity. However, the fact that the founders and revered leaders of other major world religions, as well as influential secular thinkers, hold Jesus in such high esteem is powerful testimony. It underscores his undeniable existence as a historical figure and highlights the universal appeal of his exceptional life and moral teachings, which are recognized across religious and cultural boundaries.</p>

                <h3>A Narrative Rooted in History</h3>
                <p>These external validations do not "prove" the Bible in a scientific sense, but they powerfully demonstrate that its narratives are not a collection of myths created in a vacuum. Instead, they are deeply embedded in the historical, cultural, and literary world of the ancient Near East. The parallels in law, ritual, and historical memory show that the biblical authors were chronicling real events and traditions, using familiar forms to convey a unique theological message.</p>

                <h3>A Note on Scholarly Interpretation</h3>
                <p>It is important to note that scholars interpret these parallels in different ways. Some view them as direct confirmation of the biblical accounts. Others see them as evidence that the ancient Israelites were participating in a shared cultural heritage, adapting common stories, laws, and literary forms to express their own unique theology. Both perspectives acknowledge that the Bible is a document of its time, deeply engaged with the world around it.</p>
